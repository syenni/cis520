I had to add the alarm-mega file, and set it to 70 alarms.

Using the greg -r alarm-multiple * command, I learned that Make.tests, Rubric.alarm,
tests.c, and alarm-zero were used for alarm-multiple. I added code to allow an
alarm-mega text to run.

Then I used the pintos -v--- run alarm-mega > log-mega.txt command to run the alarm
and output the results to the log-mega.txt file.
